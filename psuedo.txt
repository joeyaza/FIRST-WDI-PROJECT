Bubbles: the game

styled like the apple iphone background, random bubbles will appear in varying sizes on the screen in a fade in / fade out fashion. 
players will be given 20 seconds to burst as many bubbles as possible using the cursor to click on the bubble itself.
after 20 seconds the game will end and it will be the second players turn.

counter in the background will count up the amount of bubbles burst per player and define the winner.

their will be music in the background 

each bubble will have a sound effect when burst.

the ethos of the game will be more of a relaxing experience as opposed to clicking and bursting as much as possible with ambient music and calming sound effects.

background: will be a static image, in a calming colour such as a tonal baby blue.

bubbles will not neccessarily move but will fade in and out of the screen.

clicking on the bubble will make the bubble burst and disappear.

I am going to try and implement it to be random where on the screen the bubbles appear and how many appear.

will need a click listener on the bubbles themselves so once pressed - bubble will be burst and disappear.
