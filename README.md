#PREMISE

an ethereal visual and audio experience to achieve pleasant tranquility.

#CODING

5 seperate functions.

 2 functions define the way the bubbles move. Have random times (between a top 
 bottom value) for how long the bubble stays in one place, then the time it takes
 to fade in/out so gives the game a more of an unplanned feel.

 1 function defines what happens when you click on a bubble.
 a sound effect plays and a counter is added to in the background per player.

 2 function define each players playing time (ie currently 20 seconds).

#CHALLENGES

id like to improve the animation when the bubble bursts. At the moment the bubble 
fades to one corner which looks good and is a vast improvement from it just
disappearing however would be good if the burst resembles an actual bubble somewhat.

id also like to improve the sound effects. Again, this is an area I am pleased
with however could look to improve.
